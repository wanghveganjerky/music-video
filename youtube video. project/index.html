    Ah, now I don't hardly know her
    But I think I can love her
    Crimson and clover
    Ah, now when she comes walkin' over
    Now I've been waitin' to show her
    Crimson and clover
    Over and over

    Yeah (Ba-da, da-da, da-da)
    My, my, such a sweet thing (Ba-da, da-da, da-da)
    I wanna do everything (Ba-da, da-da, da-da)
    What a beautiful feelin' (Ba-da, da-da, da-da)
    Crimson and clover (Ba-da, da-da, da-da)
    Over and over

    Crimson and clover, over and over
    Crimson and clover, over and over
    Crimson and clover, over and over
    Crimson and clover, over and over </pre>
